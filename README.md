# Smudge Timer

A Simple .NET 6.0 Timer to help time how long it takes Ghosts in Phasmophobia to hunt again after getting smudged.

## How to Use

The Smudge Timer provides two ways to time ghost hunts: using keyboard shortcuts or the Start/Stop button within the app.

### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

1. **Prime the Timer**:
   - Press `F1` to prime the timer. This prepares it to start counting up when you trigger it.
   - While primed, the timer numbers will visually flash, indicating that it's ready to start.

2. **Trigger the Timer**:
   - To start the timer, `right-click` while the timer is primed (using `F1`).
   - The timer will begin counting up from zero.

3. **Stop the Timer**:
   - If you wish to stop the timer, press `F1` again while the timer is running.
   - This will halt the timer's counting.

4. **Deprime the Timer**:
   - To deprime the `right-click` (prevent it from starting the timer), press `F1` once more.
   - The timer will no longer respond to right-clicks until you prime it again.

### Using the Start/Stop Button

1. **Button Usage**:
   - Within the app, you'll find a "Start" button.
   - Click the "Start" button to begin the timer. The button will change to "Stop."

2. **Stopping the Timer**:
   - To stop the timer, click the "Stop" button while the timer is running. The button text will update to "Start."

Please note that the Smudge Timer counts up like a stopwatch, measuring the elapsed time accurately from zero when started. The visual flashing of the timer numbers, when it's primed, serves as an indicator that the timer is ready to start.

That's it! The Smudge Timer offers both keyboard shortcuts and a user-friendly button interface for tracking ghost hunt timings in Phasmophobia.
